# HCAD
My OpenSCAD library.

Files on this folder are tools, and build/transform objects based on parameters. Each tool is docummented in it's own comments.

Files in obj/ are real-life objects and therefore not usually customizable, but some objects may have parameters that affect how they are rendered. They are povided mostly for visualization purposes.
